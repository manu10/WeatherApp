# WeatherApp
An Android toy app that follows Clean Architecture principles and is used for me to learn to use different libraries

## Architecture
The app is developed using MVVM, using modules to separate the different architecture layers

The Main libraries used for the project are:

Dagger 2 - For DI
Retrofit - For Network requests
RXJava - For asynchronous task
ConstraintLayout, Data binding and livedata - For the UI
Moshi - For Serialization
JUnit4, Mockito - For Unit Testing
